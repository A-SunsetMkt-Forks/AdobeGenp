NSudo is a system management tool for advanced users to launch programs with full privileges.

It was created by the M2Team, and it is fully open source.
If you do not trust it, you can remove it safely and GenP will operate as expected.
However, without it, Adobe Xd and other UWP apps cannot be cured.
