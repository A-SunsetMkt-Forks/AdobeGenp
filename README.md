GenP 3.4.14.1 ReleaseFull changelog:

Fixed the issue where people with corrupted Windows installations could not use RunAsTI/NSudo.
GenP will now ask if you want to run as a Trusted Installer on startup.
If you see GenP crash on startup or your mouse cursor spins endlessly
Press “no” on this popup after closing GenP in Task Manager.

Added support for Audition (Beta).
(PS: Previous versions of GenP damaged Audition Beta’s files
Reinstall it before trying to patch it again.)

Added support for Character Animator (Beta).

Packed NSudo and the config.ini files within the executable itself
As a result, GenP is now one single executable
(Which works without extracting the files, we still recommend you extract it, though)

Fixed the issue where people’s hosts files would get overwritten at times.

Added support for x86 installations of Creative Cloud, so you don’t have to manually pick the path

Removed support for Cinema 4D as the version bundled with After Effects is no longer supported

Improved scanning speed.

Improved PowerShell code for systems that are badly configured
or have corrupted environment variables.

Fixed weird C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile error
(When the CC files are not found when patching CC).

Fixed typo (grammatical errors) in ARM detection code.

General stability/code fixes.
