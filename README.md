Changelog:

v3.6.2 Changelog:
– Popup Tools -> Runtime Installer section updated.
It was brought to my attention that some apps or versions may not like their RuntimeInstaller.dll file being renamed
(deleting or renaming the file removed popups). This rename method was added in v3.6.0/1 due to After Effects and
Premiere Pro packing their files with custom UPX, so the new patch/pattern from @xanax could not be found.

As of v3.6.2, I have added a custom UPX binary to unpack these files and the Popup Tools -> Runtime Installer ->
Unpack button will now automate this process (instead of simply renaming the file). After unpacking the file(s),
they can be patched with AdobeGenP to apply the xanax popup patch (or any other patches) to the file.
