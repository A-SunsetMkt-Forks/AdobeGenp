Changelog:


GenP CGP Community Edition v3.4.2

” Release Notes:
– commented out “UnlicensedPS”, “UnlicensedIllustrator2023/b” patches to fix some apps crashing.

These should have been removed long ago, as they didn’t solve the unlicensed/genuine popups some receive — more recently they are causing some newer app builds to crash at launch.

Maybe if I ever get a pop-up they can be properly patched out without HOSTS/firewall blocks.

As long as nothing else changes (famous last words…), this should be ready to go for the stable v2025 apps which will drop any time now.

GENP 3.3.5 Changes

This has better code for Pop-up Blocker which checks for 3rd party firewall and notifies user with instructions and dynamically fetches latest xxxxxxxxxx.adobestats.io domain to query for IP addresses.
It has an options tab, to allow you to select if you want to search for ACC, and if you want to find files in any folder you create – useful for testers/repackers or anyone with a really weird folder structure.
The options are read in from the config.ini file.
If you change options, you can save them to the config.ini with the Save Options button, so that they stick on future launches.

3.3.6 Changelog:

Reworked pop-up code to parse every xxxxxxxxxx.adobestats.io url from a.dove.isdumb.one/pihole.txt, resolve all the IP addresses and create a firewall rule that combines them.

3.3.7 Changelog:

his release has updated config.ini that patches InDesign.
On the options tab, you can select custom domains to use for pop-up blocker. By default, they are set to 2 xxxxxxxxxx.adobestats.io addresses that are currently used, but you can add/remove as required. This basically allows you to choose between 3.3.4 and 3.3.6 method of blocking. It is also future-proof, in case a.dove.isdumb.one/pihole.txt gets taken down, and has error checking for 0.0.0.0/127.0.0.1 in IPs which is a sign of unclean hosts, which is preventing all IPs being detected. It will abort if this is the case, rather than blocking all Internet traffic!

3.3.8 Changelog:

This version is a bug fix for version 3.3.7
Improved Pop-up code to prevent app hanging under particular circumstances.
Improved Saving config code to prevent completely removing default hosts.

3.3.10 Changelog:

This will patch PS properly. It will patch Adobe Illustrator 2023 properly.
I cannot get a pop-up in Ai 2024.

3.3.10 has a new Pop-up Tools tab. Full of goodies for experts and testing.
Anyone with pop-up in 2024 versions of Ai, please try nuking AGS from this page, remove all firewall and hosts rules, and see if you still get pop-up.
